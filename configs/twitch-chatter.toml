# OBS Scenes configuration section.
#
# This section sets up the command !scene
# !scene is used by approved_users
# (and moderators if [plugins] in_channel = true)
#
# The full command syntax
# !scene scenename
# Where scenename is one of the scene commands below.
#
# Commands are a map of command names to obs scene name. The mapping allows a
# broadcaster to hide their actual scene names. The command can be any name.
#
# eg:
# fullscreen = "actual_obs_scene_name"
# sidebyside = "other_obs_scene_name"
#
# note:
# commands must not contain spaces.
# "command name" will not work. Use "commandname" or "command_name" instead.
